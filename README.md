# Machine Learning Based GlowSkinFit – PBL 1 (Final Model)
This project is developed as part of Project-Based Learning 1 (PBL 1) with the aim of applying theoretical concepts of Machine Learning to solve a real-world problem using data-driven approaches.
The project focuses on building an end-to-end Machine Learning model, starting from raw data processing to final model evaluation. It demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to extract meaningful patterns from data and make accurate predictions or classifications.
The entire implementation is carried out in a Jupyter Notebook environment, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and ease of understanding. Each stage of the pipeline is clearly structured and documented, making the project suitable for both academic evaluation and practical learning.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
-To understand the complete Machine Learning workflow
-To perform data preprocessing and cleaning
-To apply suitable machine learning algorithms
-To evaluate model performance using standard metrics
-To interpret results and analyze model behavior

## Problem Approach
The project follows a systematic approach:
#### 1. Data Collection & Loading
The dataset is loaded and inspected to understand its structure and attributes.
#### 2. Data Preprocessing
-Handling missing or inconsistent values
-Feature scaling and normalization
-Encoding categorical variables
#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-Visualization techniques are used to identify trends, correlations, and data distributions.
#### 4. Model Development
-A machine learning model is trained using appropriate algorithms based on the problem type (classification/regression).
#### 5. Model Evaluation
-Performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix where applicable.
#### 6. Result Interpretation
-The results are analyzed to determine the effectiveness and reliability of the model.
